# 🌌 Ethenios: The Lost Rift

**Ethenios** is a high-stakes 2D Action-Adventure platformer. Navigate through atmospheric landscapes, master precision movement, and overcome the rocky sentinels of a world that resets its challenges the moment you fall.

## 📖 The Narrative: A World Unwelcoming
You are the **Outsider**. After a reality-bending accident, you have slipped through a fissure into *Ethenios*—a lush but hostile dimension where nature and stone possess a shared consciousness. You do not belong here.

The world itself rejects your presence. To escape, you must traverse the Whispering Wilds and the Midnight Thicket to find the dimensional rift home. But the rift requires energy: **Aether Shards**. These glowing, diamond-like rocks are the crystallized life force of this world, and taking them enrages the guardians.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 💎 The Economy of Light (XP & Tokens)
Survival isn't just about reaching the end; it's about gathering power.
* **Aether Shards (Tokens):** Scattered across the map are glowing, diamond-like rocks. Collecting these fuels your **Experience HUD**, directly tracking your progress toward stabilizing the exit portal.
* **Perma-State Reset:** If you fall, the world rewinds. All Shards respawn, and your collected XP for that run resets. Mastery is required.

### 🗿 The Stone Legion (Enemy Variations)
The forest is protected by ancient rock-constructs. While they share a similar rugged, rocky appearance, their behaviors differ significantly:
* **Moss-Crag Sentinels (Patrollers):** Mobile golems that tirelessly walk fixed paths along the terrain.
* **Rooted Guardians (Static):** Stationary blockers that force you to find vertical routes around them.
* **Spore-Wardens (Shooters):** Stationary turrets that fire projectiles, demanding precise timing to dodge.

### 🏃 Precision Traversal
* **Kinetic Platforms:** Moving terrain that requires players to maintain momentum while the ground shifts beneath them.
* **Variable Jump Heights:** Control your ascent with frame-perfect input.
* **Stomp Combat:** Turn gravity into a weapon by landing crushing blows on enemy heads.
